# First Exploration of Seattle Airbnb Data
## Project Motivation
The motivation for this project to make first steps to the data science field. I tried to discover data and gain some insight. I focused on three points:
1. **Demand by Property Types:** Observing property type preferences and supply-demand gap for them.
1. **Never Without Internet:** Understanding of most crucial amenities that are served by hosts.
1. **Time To Bet: Forecasts:** Trials to build a simple linear model to predict fullness of hosts.
## Install
Python3 has been used for this project. Some of the libraries should be had and they are available in the code.
* NumPy
* Pandas
* mathplotlib
* scikit-learn
## File Descriptions
* **Data:** *listing.csv* has a list of all places in Seattle and detailed information. *Reviews.csv* includes comments that customers made. *Calendar.csv* show the availability and price of all places for one-year.
* **Code** Four jupyter notebook, one of which is used to explore data and remainings are for the answer to each question.
